This is the bespoke block theme built for the [Cole Parker Randall Foundation](https://smilesforsma.org), completed in September of 2025. This is part of a collection of themes I am developing to hone a killer starter for WordPress + Tailwind, Ursula.

## Goals

I was after several goals on this build:

- Create a library of blocks that are intuitive and easy
- Leverage [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for layout development
- Unify styles across plugins for a seamless user experience

This build is for demonstration purposes only. If you choose to download this theme and try to run it, you will need ACF Pro installed for it to function properly.

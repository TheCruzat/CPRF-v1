This is the bespoke block theme built for the [Cole Parker Randall Foundation](https://smilesforsma.org), completed in September of 2025. This is part of a collection of themes I am developing to hone a killer starter for WordPress + Tailwind, Ursula.

## Goals

I was after several goals on this build:

- Create a library of blocks that are intuitive and easy
- Leverage [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for layout development
- Unify styles across plugins for a seamless user experience

## Highlights

- Bespoke [Lightbox](https://github.com/TheCruzat/CPRF-v1/blob/a88d8c01626970df1c7cbbf4c81c920c36088193/js/scripts.js#L49) functionality

This build is for demonstration purposes only.
